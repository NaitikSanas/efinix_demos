DDR Read/Write Example Design (T120 BGA324)



The design demonstrates a project using the T120F324I4 FPGA's DDR

interface to perform a simple read/write test for the LPDDR3

memory chip on the TrionÂ® T120 BGA423 Development Board.





Requirements:



Efinity software version 2019.3 or later

Trion T120 BGA324 Development Kit
