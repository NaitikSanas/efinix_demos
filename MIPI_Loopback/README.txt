Trion T20 MIPI Development Kit: Loopback Example Design


The mipi_loopback_top Efinity project helps you verify the functionality of
the MIPI TX and RX interfaces on the Trion T20 MIPI development board. The 
FPGA generates a video pattern and transmits it out the MIPI TX and receives 
it on the MIPI RX. LEDs blink to indicate that the received data is correct. 



Requirements:


Efinity software version 2019.2 or later

TrionÂ® T20 MIPI Development Board
2 Raspberry Pi Camera Connector Daughter Cards
15-pin FFC/FPC cable
Optional: Raspberry Pi VGA666 DPI dtoverlays module (also called a Gert-VGA-666
module) to view output on a VGA monitor (available from vendors online)
